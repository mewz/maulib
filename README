Lib designed to security handle buffers and other tasks. The other goal is that if the implementation of a function needs to be changed
due to a security or performance issue, you'll only need one place to go to make those changes. To put it another way, this encapsulates
common functions that are considered security and/or performance issues - or to simply make life easier.


- strutils
  Helper functions designed to safely handle string buffers. I've chosen to not use realloc because this function contains side effects in that
  the pointer address may change. Therefor any other pointers pointing to this address must also be update. Also, if realloc changes pointer locations
  it does not nullify the memory previous memory block and this could lead to privacy issues.
  Contains the following functions:
  	   str_malloc - malloc a and nullify a buffer
	   create_new_string - Creates a malloced string buffer. Caller is responsible for freeing it.
	   append_cstring - Creates a new malloced string that appends one string to another string. Caller is responsible
	   		    for freeing the original and returned string.
	   secure_free_cstring - Sets the memory buffer to null, then free's it.
